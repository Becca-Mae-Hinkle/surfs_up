## CHALLENGE OVERVIEW

This project explores the power of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to efficently produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature data were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

## Challenge Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June 

Deliverable2 : Determine the Summary Statistics for December 

Deliverable3 : A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Results

* Summary Statistics DataFrame: June vs December Temperatures

Weather Differences in Oahu, Hawaii

The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.

The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a tight bell curve distribution, upheld by the smaller measurement of June temps vs December temps

The December temperatures seem to be more variable than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures (comparing the max vs min temp of each month)

In summary, even though the temperatures recorded in December vary more than those in June, December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for surfing and ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December only differ by 4 degrees. December's median temperature, with the highest frequency recorded across a span of years, is about 72 degrees, at least double the frequency of the next highest recorded temperatures, 75 and 67 respectively. 

Before making a final deicision though, I would want to perform some additional queries to get more color on weather conditions in these two months.

1. I would like to perform summary statistics of temperatures recorded by each station for each month. This can help determine geopgraphically where in Oahu to build the prospective shop. By comparing the variances in temperatures and the frequencies recorded, we can narrow in on an optimal location.

2. I would also like to review other variables that can show  what factors provide optimal beach and surfing weather. Sunch varibles include precipitation, wave swells and wind condition. Though there may be some contrasting optimal conditions based on surfing vs sunbathing, it is important to identify those conditions and see how they correlate to foot traffic to the beach depending on the time of year.

For specificity, I would like to delve into the summary statistics of temperatures recorded by station for each month. This can help determine geopgraphically where in Oahu to build the prospective shop. By comparing the variances in temperatures and the frequencies recorded, we can narrow in on an optimal location.
